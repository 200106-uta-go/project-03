#Istio "Demo" dev environment
You may need to chmod the commands. Terraform isn't running the command at the monent
Three commands can be used to start the environment

./mlbStart.sh
This will start the load balancer and return a list of the nodes. A range containing these needs to be put
into the config.yaml. Run the next command after that is completed.

./istioStart.sh
This will start the istio sdn, running the demo profile. This will block the command line. Use ctlz to
use the command line after the profile is started.

./istioCont.sh
This will complete the start up. You can go to the ip of the master node :32077/productpage to test that bookinfo is running
